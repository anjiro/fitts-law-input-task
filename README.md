## Fitt's Law Input Task
Fitts' Law experiment/demo web application.

Forked from http://twinji.github.io/fitts-law-input-task/ , modified in various ways to suit my purposes:

- Scale targets if too big for screen
- Different data in output CSV
- No practice mode
- Ability to paste in custom D and W values
